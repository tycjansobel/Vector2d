## Vector2d
Library for vector calculations.

### Available language implementation
- [C++](https://github.com/mrtycjan/Vector2d#for-c)
- [Lua](https://github.com/mrtycjan/Vector2d#for-lua)
- [Java](https://github.com/mrtycjan/Vector2d#for-java)

### How to use?
First choose implementation language according with yours.

### For C++
Download and paste Vector2d.cpp and Vector2d.h files from C++ folder into your project directory. In first lines of code add a preprocesor directive 
```cpp
#include "Vector2d.h"
```
![cpp](http://i.imgur.com/ixyyilq.png)

We use "" becouse we keep this files in project directory.

### How to integrate with project (C++)
Take look at [Example Integration](https://github.com/mrtycjan/Vector2d/blob/master/C++/ExampleIntegrationWithSFML.cpp)

### What this all Functions do? (C++)
Many of functions implemented in Vector2d is Overridden. What it's mean? You can use the same function with multiple arguments. Also they have a default value for non-necessary arguments. Every functions have long name, which simply explains what they do, just take a look at Vector2d.h and comments.

```cpp
	static float radiansToDegrees(float radians); //Convert Radians into Degrees

	static float degreesToRadians(float degrees); //Convert Degrees into Radians
	
	static float rotationInRadiansFromVector(float vectorX, float vectorY); //Compute rotation from computed vector, returns rotation in radians

	static float rotationInRadiansFromVector(float fromX, float fromY, float toX, float toY); //Compute vector and rotation from vector, returns rotation in radians

	static float rotationInDegreesFromVector(float vectorX, float vectorY); //Compute rotation from computed vector, returns rotation in degrees

	static float rotationInDegreesFromVector(float fromX, float fromY, float toX, float toY); //Compute vector and rotation from vector, returns rotation in degrees

	static Vector2d pointToPointVector(float toX, float toY, float fromX, float fromY, float deltaTime = 1, float velocity = 1); //Compute vector, optional arguments, deltaTime, object velocity
	
	static Vector2d vectorFromRotationInRadians(float rotationInRadians, float deltaTime = 1, float velocity = 1); //Compute vector from rotation in radians, optional arguments, deltaTime, object velocity

	static Vector2d vectorFromRotationInDegrees(float rotationInDegrees, float deltaTime = 1, float velocity = 1); //Compute vector from rotation in degrees, optional arguments, deltaTime, object velocity

```

### For Lua
With Lua it will be a little bit more easier, download and paste into project folder Vector2d.lua from Lua folder. Finally add this as a Lua module just add this line of code.

```lua
Vector2d = require("Vector2d")
```
### How to integrate with project (Lua)
Take look at [Example Integration](https://github.com/mrtycjan/Vector2d/blob/master/Lua/LuaIntegration.lua)

### Functions (Lua)

```lua
function Vector2d.pointToPointVector(from, to) --> first create object with x and y components e.g Object = {x, y}. In fact Lua is non-objective language, but you can pretend it, using metatables. This function counting vector of Movement based of coordinates

function Vector2d.vectorFromRotationInRadians(rotationInRadians, velocity) --> This function counting vector of Movement based of object rotation in Radians, optional arguments it's speed of object

function Vector2d.vectorFromRotationInDegrees(rotationInDegrees, velocity) --> This function counting vector of Movement based of object rotation in Degrees, optional arguments it's speed of object

function Vector2d.rotationInDegreesFromVector(vectorOfMovement) --> Based on vector counting rotation and return value in Degrees
	
function Vector2d.rotationInRadiansFromVector(vectorOfMovement) --> Based on vector counting rotation and return value in Radians
	
function Vector2d.radiansToDegrees(radians) --> Converts radians to degrees

function Vector2d.degreesToRadians(degrees) --> Converts degrees to radians


```

### For Java
Download and paste into project 'ml/tycjan/vector2d' folder, and import packages, just add this line of code

```java
import ml.tycjan.vector2d.*;
```

### How to integrate with project (Java)
Take a look at [Example Integration](https://github.com/mrtycjan/Vector2d/blob/master/Java/IntegrationWithJava.java)

### Functions (Java)

```java

public Vector2d(float x, float y) //Constructor
	
public void setX(float x) //Just Getters and setters

public void setY(float y) //Just Getters and setters

public float getX() //Just Getters and setters

public float getY()	//Just Getters and setters

public static float radiansToDegrees(float radians) //Convert radians to degrees
	
public static float degreesToRadians(float degrees) //Convert degrees to radianas
	
public static float rotationInRadiansFromVector(float toX, float toY, float fromX, float fromY) //Compute rotation, based on vector and return angle in radians 

public static float rotationInRadiansFromVector(Vector2d vector) // The same but the function is overridden, so yo can use computed vector as argument
	
public static float rotationInDegreesFromVector(float toX, float toY, float fromX, float fromY) //Compute rotation, based on vector and return angle in radians 
	
public static float rotationInDegreesFromVector(Vector2d vector) // The same but the function is overridden, so yo can use computed vector as argument
	
public static Vector2d pointToPointVector(float toX, float toY, float fromX, float fromY) //Compute vector based on actual position

public static Vector2d pointToPointVector(Vector2d to, Vector2d from) // The same but function is overridden you can use vector objects provided from Vector2d class
	
public static Vector2d vectorFromRotationInRadians(float radians) //Compute vector based on rotation
	
public static Vector2d vectorFromRotationInDegrees(float degrees) //Compute vector based on rotation
